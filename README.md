## Description

<img src="https://github.com/zenangst/Differific/blob/master/Images/Differific-icon.png?raw=true" alt="Differific Icon" align="right" />

**Differific** is a diffing tool that helps you compare Hashable objects using the Paul Heckel's diffing algorithm. Creating a changeset is seamless for all your diffing needs. The library also includes some convenience extensions to make life easier when updating data sources.

The library is based and highly influenced by Matias Cudich's ([@mcudich](https://github.com/mcudich)) [HeckelDiff](https://github.com/mcudich/HeckelDiff) library that aims to solve the same issue. Versions prior to 0.3.0 was based on [DeepDiff](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff).
For more information about how the algorithm works and the performance of the algorithm, head over to [DeepDiff](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff/blob/master/README.md#among-different-frameworks). For the time being, both frameworks are very similar; this is subject to change when the frameworks evolve.
